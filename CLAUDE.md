# OpenAlice

File-driven AI trading agent. All state (sessions, config, logs) stored as files — no database.

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # Dev mode (tsx watch, port 3002)
pnpm build      # Production build (backend + UI)
pnpm test       # Vitest
pnpm test:e2e   # e2e test
```

### Pre-commit Verification

Always run these checks before committing:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit   # Type check (catches errors pnpm build misses)
pnpm test           # Unit tests
```

`pnpm build` uses tsup which is lenient — `tsc --noEmit` catches strict type errors that tsup ignores.

## Subsystem guides

Some parts of this codebase are structured in ways that aren't obvious from
the code alone — easy to touch superficially, easy to miss load-bearing
wiring. When working on one of these, read its guide first:

- **Event / Listener / Producer system** — [docs/event-system.md](docs/event-system.md).
  Read before adding a new event type, Listener, or Producer, or before
  opening an event to HTTP via the webhook ingest. Has recipes + the full
  list of files to touch for each kind of change, plus a "common pitfalls"
  section for the kinds of things AI sessions have historically half-done.

## Working with TODO.md

`TODO.md` at the repo root is the running backlog — deferred work, known
bugs, security gaps, and design items sitting in the on-deck circle.
Unfinished items there compound over time if they're forgotten.

- **Before starting non-trivial work**, scan `TODO.md` for related entries.
  If there's one, either (a) handle it as part of the current change, or
  (b) confirm with the user why you're skipping it so it doesn't drift.
- **When finishing a change**, if it resolves a TODO entry, delete that
  entry in the same commit (git log is the history — the file is a
  future-looking list, not an audit trail).
- **When a new item surfaces mid-work** — a known-broken behaviour you
  don't have scope to fix, a security concern, a half-done UI surface —
  add it with enough context (symptom + suspected location) that the
  next person can start without re-derivation.

## Key Architecture

### AgentCenter → GenerateRouter → GenerateProvider

Two layers (Engine was removed):

1. **AgentCenter** (`core/agent-center.ts`) — top-level orchestration. Manages sessions, compaction, and routes calls through GenerateRouter. Exposes `ask()` (stateless) and `askWithSession()` (with history).

2. **GenerateRouter** (`core/ai-provider-manager.ts`) — reads `ai-provider.json` on each call, resolves to active provider. Two backends:
   - Agent SDK (`inputKind: 'text'`) — Claude via @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk, tools via in-process MCP
   - Vercel AI SDK (`inputKind: 'messages'`) — direct API calls, tools via Vercel tool system

**AIProvider interface**: `ask(prompt)` for one-shot, `generate(input, opts)` for streaming `ProviderEvent` (tool_use / tool_result / text / done). Optional `compact()` for provider-native compaction.

**StreamableResult**: dual interface — `PromiseLike` (await for result) + `AsyncIterable` (for-await for streaming). Multiple consumers each get independent cursors.

Per-request provider and model overrides via `AskOptions.provider` and `AskOptions.vercelAiSdk` / `AskOptions.agentSdk`.

### ConnectorCenter

`connector-center.ts` manages push channels (Web, Telegram, MCP Ask). Tracks last-interacted channel for delivery routing.

### ToolCenter

Centralized registry. `tool/` files register tools via `ToolCenter.register()`, exports in Vercel and MCP formats. Decoupled from AgentCenter.

## Conventions

- ESM only (`.js` extensions in imports), path alias `@/*` → `./src/*`
- Strict TypeScript, ES2023 target
- Zod for config, TypeBox for tool parameter schemas
- `decimal.js` for financial math
- Pino logger → `logs/engine.log`

## Git Workflow

- `origin` = `TraderAlice/OpenAlice` (production)
- `dev` branch for all development, `master` only via PR
- **Never** force push master, **never** push `archive/dev` (contains old API keys)
- CLAUDE.md is **committed to the repo and publicly visible** — never put API keys, personal paths, or sensitive information in it

### Branch Safety Rules

- **NEVER delete `dev` or `master` branches** — both are protected on GitHub (`allow_deletions: false`, `allow_force_pushes: false`)
- When merging PRs, **NEVER use `--delete-branch`** — it deletes the source branch and destroys commit history
- When merging PRs, **prefer `--merge` over `--squash`** — squash destroys individual commit history. If the PR has clean, meaningful commits, merge them as-is
- If squash is needed (messy history), do it — but never combine with `--delete-branch`
- `archive/dev-pre-beta6` is a historical snapshot — do not modify or delete
- **After merging a PR**, always `git pull origin master` to sync local master. Stale local master causes confusion about what's merged and what's not.
- **Before creating a PR**, always `git fetch origin master` to check what's already merged. Use `git log --oneline origin/master..HEAD` to verify only the intended commits are ahead. Stale local refs cause PRs with wrong diff.

### Rolling dev → master PR convention

Multiple Claude sessions hit `dev` in parallel; GitHub allows only **one
open PR per (head, base) pair** anyway. So we keep a single rolling PR
from `dev → master` and **append** to its body each session instead of
opening fresh — otherwise each new PR loses the context of what other
sessions did.

**Before opening a new PR, always check first:**

```bash
gh pr list --base master --head dev --state open --json number,title,body
```

- **If a PR exists** → append your section to its body with
  `gh pr edit <num> --body-file <(...)`. Don't open a new one.
- **If none exists** → open with `gh pr create` using the template below.

**PR body template:**

```markdown
## Summary
<rolling thematic summary — latest session may rewrite this when new
work meaningfully shifts the PR's framing>

## Per-session contributions
### YYYY-MM-DD — <session theme, e.g. "Market workbench tradeable card">
- What changed (1–3 bullets)
- Why
- Key commits: `<sha-short>`, `<sha-short>`

### YYYY-MM-DD — <prior session theme>
…(append on top, keep prior sessions verbatim — never edit other sessions' entries)…

## Full commit log
<output of: git log --oneline origin/master..HEAD>
(regenerate from scratch on each body update)

## Test plan
- [ ] tsc --noEmit clean
- [ ] pnpm test passes
- [ ] (session-specific manual verifications)

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
```

**When you append:**

1. Refresh the "Full commit log" section from `git log --oneline origin/master..HEAD`.
2. Add your "Per-session contributions" entry on top of the list, with today's date.
3. Don't edit other sessions' entries — that's their record.
4. Update "Summary" only if your work actually changes the PR's framing
   (e.g., what was a "frontend tweak" PR becomes a "frontend + new domain
   service" PR after your work).

This keeps the PR description as a faithful audit trail across sessions,
and lets reviewers see who-did-what without trawling the commit log alone.

### Default vs. isolated branch — when to deviate from `dev`

The default for any session is **work on `dev`** and let the rolling
PR carry it to master. The exception is **invasive, long-running work
that shouldn't share a branch with parallel sessions** — typically a
refactor of shared types / cross-cutting infrastructure that, while
in-flight, would force every other session to rebase against churn
they don't have context for.

Examples worth isolating: changing a base interface every broker
implements; renaming or restructuring a module everyone imports from;
multi-day schema migrations.
Examples that stay on `dev`: any feature, any local fix, anything
scoped to one subsystem.

When isolation is the right call:

```bash
# Branch from master (clean baseline, dev's churn won't bleed in)
git fetch origin
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b refactor/<short-name>

# During the refactor, periodically rebase against master so the
# eventual merge stays small. Skip dev — its session-by-session
# churn is intentionally not part of the baseline you're testing
# against.
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master

# When done, PR straight to master (NOT dev). The refactor is its own
# coherent unit, reviewed end-to-end.
git push -u origin refactor/<short-name>
gh pr create --base master --head refactor/<short-name> ...
```

**After the refactor merges**, dev needs to absorb the new master so
in-flight sessions land on the new baseline:

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git fetch origin
git merge origin/master
git push origin dev
```

In-flight rolling-PR work then sees the refactor in their next pull
and rebases naturally. Their diffs against the refreshed `dev` may
need real fix-ups (that's the cost of an invasive refactor — and
the reason you isolated it in the first place).

**Decision rule for the next session that starts work:** if `master`
is currently ahead of `dev` (because a refactor branch just landed
there), do `git checkout dev && git merge origin/master` *before*
starting any new feature work. Otherwise your new commits will land
on a stale baseline.

**Parallel work happens in the cloud, not in local worktrees.** For a
project this size, spinning up multiple local worktrees costs more
in `pnpm install` / `data/` copying / port juggling than it saves.
Hand parallel tracks off to cloud Claude sessions instead — each
gets its own sandbox, returns a PR, and doesn't touch the local
working tree.
